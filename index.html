    <p>It was a dark and stormy night when I found a former best friend was dead. </p>
    <P>I thought I was in a Law and Order: SVU episode! (play law and order theme song)</P>
    <p>Then it occured to me why this friend was in fact, a former friend. We'd had a falling out.</p>
    <p>Quickly, I realized that this scene wasn'tooking good for me and I better get the hell out of town, heck maybe even the country.</p>


    <p>But..........</p>

    <p>A quote from Nietzsche came to my mind, "That which does not kill you makes you stronger." </p>
